# # # # Lab 1 Binary Search Pseudocode # # # #

- Given a sorted data structure, we wish to find if search criteria
  is contained within it.

1: Find last and first element of data structure, assign
  min and max values to their indices

2: Find middle index of current list: mid = (max-min)/2
	If max-min is even, subtract 1 from min (Index starts from 0)
	If odd do nothing (integer division fixes this for us)

3: Check search criteria against datastructure[mid]
	If search criteria is greater than datastructure[mid]:
		min = mid
	If search criteria is less than datastructure[mid]:
		max = mid
	If search criteria equals datastructure[mid]:
		We've found what we're looking for, end.

4: If mid = 0, end - the search criteria is not contained
   within this list, else go to 5
   
5: Repeat from step 2 until end condition is met
